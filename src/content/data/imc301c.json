They are a young couple in their 30s with 2 young children. They travel mostly within Spain by car, and like to go to places where there is lots to do for the kids, but also fun for him and his wife. They don't expect to spend a lot of time in the room, so he looks for hotels that have a convenient location, good rates and dependable service. What he really appreciates are small extras for the kids, and rooms that feel updated. They had set their sight on going to Valencia, because of the existence of both beach and the Oceanographic site. Peter asked a colleague from work who had recently visited Valencia, and he recommended our client’s hotel. Peter immediately went online, looked at the hotels website pictures, and once he got approval from Anne, he decided to go ahead and book. It took him 45 minutes browsing through different booking engines to actually make the reservation, because pricing was different in every website, which really annoyed him. Let’s fast forward to the actual arrival at the hotel. After the long drive, Peter and Anne began their check in process and the kids were roaming around the lobby playing with the luggage. Anne got really nervous that they would knock down some vases that are part of the décor. Once finished the check in process, they took the elevator up to their rooms, only to find out that they weren’t connecting rooms. Annoyed, Peter went downstairs and after a long discussion with the reception clerk, he came up with the keys to connecting rooms. When they entered the rooms, the décor was updated, but the bed was hard as wood, and the bathroom had no bathtub (for the kids) and the shower hadn’t been updated in a while. Let’s Fast forward again to their departure day. Early in the morning, they received an envelope with the bill under their door. After revising it, Peter realizes that there were some minibar charges that weren’t theirs. He went downstairs to reception to find a long cue. During this wait, he decides to write a review of the hotel on the Internet. After 15 minutes and a bit of discussion, he is finally able to sort out the bill and complete the check-out process.\"",
