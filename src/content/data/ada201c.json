    "question": "Step 1: Understand the data First, look over the data to identify any sensitive attributes. These are features in your data that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes if the model learns to rely on them too heavily. In your dataset, these might include gender, age, department, or any other attributes related to protected classes (e.g., race, religion, disability) if present in your data. Then understand the target variable. This is what you're trying to predict. What is the target variable in this project? Select the best answer.",
    "answers": ["Performance rating"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Step 2: Analyze for bias Ask the GenAI tool to run analysis on the data. Start by supplying the data and asking it to check for biases. You also may want to ask for a distribution analysis, look for any correlations, or specifically ask if your target variable has been impacted by any other variable. Examine how the sensitive attributes are distributed across different performance ratings, and look for significant disparities or imbalances. Questions to ask yourself include: Are certain genders consistently receiving lower performance ratings? Are older or younger employees disproportionately represented in certain performance categories? Are there performance disparities across different departments? Which of the following were potential biases in the given data? Select all that apply.",
    "answers": ["Education level", "Gender", "Age", "Department"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Step 3: Mitigate bias Go through your data and remove biased features. If certain attributes are clearly causing bias and aren't essential for prediction, consider removing them. If your dataset is imbalanced (e.g., far fewer female employees than male employees), techniques like oversampling or undersampling can help create a more balanced dataset. You can ask the AI to use these techniques. For example, if you wanted to take a closer look at gender you may ask the AI to use oversampling to increase the amount of non-binary data. Then, run the analyses again to see if anything correlates with performance. It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying relationships. For instance, if performance and salary are correlated, it just means that they could be influencing each other or affected by similar circumstances or patterns. For example, employees who are paid more might be motivated to give better performance, employees who give better performance are paid more for their efforts, or another variable causes both to rise or fall together, such as satisfaction, health, or tenure. What predictions would you make about future employee performance? You notice that your GenAI model predicts lower performance scores for employees from certain demographic groups. What's the most likely explanation? Select the best answer.",

    "answers": [
      "Problem 1: Legal Advice or Representation Why it’s inappropriate: While Generative AI can assist with general information and provide guidance on legal concepts, it cannot provide professional legal advice tailored to specific cases. Legal situations require a deep understanding of the law, the ability to interpret complex regulations, and contextual analysis that considers the specifics of each case. AI lacks the judgment and ethical responsibility of a licensed professional. Misusing AI for legal matters could lead to incorrect advice and potentially costly mistakes or legal liabilities. Problem 2: Mental Health Diagnosis or Treatment Why it’s inappropriate: Generative AI models are not equipped to diagnose or treat mental health conditions. Mental health care requires human empathy, understanding, and professional qualifications. AI might be able to provide general information about mental health, but it cannot replace the expertise and personalized care that a licensed therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist can offer. Moreover, AI responses are based on patterns from data and may not account for the nuances of human emotion or individual circumstances, leading to harmful or inadequate advice. Problem 3: Ethical Decision-Making in Sensitive Scenarios Why it’s inappropriate: Generative AI models lack the ability to fully understand complex ethical, moral, and cultural considerations that arise in sensitive situations, such as decisions involving life, death, or severe personal consequences. AI systems cannot factor in the broader social, emotional, or cultural contexts of human decision-making. In situations like medical end-of-life decisions, choosing between conflicting moral imperatives, or navigating interpersonal relationships with conflicting interests, human judgment and ethical principles are crucial, making AI an unreliable decision-making tool in such contexts."

By evaluating your strengths, weaknesses, resources, and challenges, you can get a clear picture of what needs to change. C – Clarify the Goal: It’s important to define your goal clearly. A well-defined goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This helps ensure you have a clear target to work towards. H – Helpful Resources: Identify what tools, skills, or resources you need to succeed. This could include learning new skills, using specific tools, or collaborating with others. I – Involvement: This step is about gathering the necessary support and resources from others. Whether it’s finding a mentor, building a team, or gaining approval from relevant stakeholders, having the right people involved can significantly impact success. E – Evaluate Options: Explore all the possible methods or strategies you can use to reach your goal. This includes considering alternative approaches and identifying the best course of action based on your assessment. V – Visualize Success: Imagine what success will look like and how it will feel once you’ve reached your goal. This visualization can motivate you to stay focused and push through challenges.
