NASA has released a random number generator which has been proven to be better than the one used by the company. He suggests that you make the change. One of your more senior developers notes that using the new generator will require a change. He suggests that the team connect the existing lotto system, as seen in Figure 1, to the new generator (Figure 2) using the Facade pattern.
