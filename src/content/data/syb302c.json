    "answers": [
      "Entrepreneurial mindset has five factors. They are; high need for achievement, individualism, locus of control focus, and optimism. Need for achievement is defined as having a preference for challenge, an acceptance of personal responsibility for outcomes, and a personal drive for accomplishment. Individualism means that entrepreneurs need less support or approval from others. High individualism is associated with an emphasis on individual initiative and achievement. Often results in entrepreneurs needing less support or approval from others. Control has two segments, which is autonomy and locus of control. Autonomy is an individual's belief about their level of freedom from the influence of others. Locus of control is an individual's belief that they can influence the environment in which they are found. People with higher levels of autonomy and an internal locus on control are more likely to discover an entrepreneurial opportunity. Internally-oriented locus of control people believed that they are able to influence their environment. Successful entrepreneurs are able to focus attention on a single task and see it through to completion. This leads selected individuals to react and to become successful entrepreneurs. While optimism enables entrepreneurs to try new things and attempt difficult tasks, optimism may also present negative impacts. Optimism leads entrepreneurs to frequently make judgements on subjective positive factors."

    "question": "BACKGROUND - Ima Founder starts her own business, NEWCO, on January 1, 2014 and sets up a corporation with 10,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share. She invests $1,000 in NEWCO in exchange for the 10,000 shares of common stock. She subsequently raises $150,000 in convertible notes, which she closes on March 1, 2014. The notes accrue simple interest at 12% per year. The maturity date of the notes is March 1, 2017, at which time all principal and accrued interest are payable to the noteholders, unless the notes are converted earlier in accordance with the note terms. From April 1 through December 31, 2014, Ima spends $72,000 in payroll costs to develop her first product, a web application used to book doctor appointments online. All costs to develop the application are expensed as incurred. On March 1, 2014, Ima enters into a lease agreement to rent office space for NEWCO. The terms of the lease include an upfront payment of a $3,000 security deposit to guarantee timely rent payment and provide for repairing any damages to the office that are not considered “normal wear and tear”, but which is refundable upon completion of the lease term. Rent is $3,000 per month, which includes ALL costs, including use of the office space, phones, use of common facilities and all Internet connectivity. Rent is payable in arrears (that is, payable on the first day of each month following a month during which the office space is occupied). On September 1, 2014, she engages the services of a UX/UI consultant to provide a professional user experience in using the web application. The consultant is paid $5,000 monthly, payable on the first day of the month following the month the work is performed. On December 1, 2014, she sells 4 annual contracts of her web application to doctor offices at a price of $60,000 per contract per year. The doctor offices have immediate use of the web application and are given 30 day payment terms. (Note: for purposes of this exercise, assume the cost of the mobile applications is negligible). ASSIGNMENT - Develop a balance sheet and an income statement for NEWCO based upon the above facts.

However, it exists to convey those aspects of your company and pique investors’ interest in hearing more. Using the following points as a guideline, develop a “winning pitch” for your new venture. (1.) Create a memorable “one-liner” - an opening vision/mission statement that catches the attention of your audience. (2.) Know your audience. (3.) Use between to 8-10 slides, providing the following information: a. Cover slide, with logo and contact information, b. Opportunity, c. Management ream, d. Product, e. Market size, f. Business model, g. Competition, h. Go-to-market strategy, i. Traction, and j. How much money you’re raising and the “use of proceeds”. (4.) If your pitch includes a demo, make sure you have enough time in the pitch session to do it properly - otherwise DON’T. You can demo the product later. -- To create your pitch deck, you may use this free tool, Google Slides (http://www.google.com/slides/about/). --How to create a new presentation Once you are in Google Drive you can create a new presentation as follows: (1) Click the red “Create” button in the top left corner (2) Then click “Presentation” from the drop-down menu (3) Your blank presentation will now open. (4) You can pick a theme for your new presentation, which you can change later if you wish. (5) You can give it a name by clicking in the “Untitled Presentation” box at the top left, and then typing in your title. You can click there again to change the title at any time. (6) Google Docs automatically saves your presentation any time you make changes. NOTE: Your submission with this assignment will not be shared with classmates, and will only be viewable by University and Coursera staff. SUBMISSION: Please paste the URL to where you posted your pitch deck online. Include your presentation notes in the \"notes\" section below each slide.
