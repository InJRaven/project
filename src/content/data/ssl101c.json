He knows that while his ideas are good, his structure and grasp of academic language are pretty bad. He asks his friend Liam, a native English speaker, to check his essay for him and suggest how he can improve it. When Liam gives him the essay back, Stuart is amazed. Liam has nicely re-written whole paragraphs of Stuart’s ideas and obviously put a lot of effort into making it sound academic.

Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher. Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that “an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration” (para. 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this – lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn’t quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the “meaning and significance” (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit “big brother” and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher.

However, there is no evidence of settlement or continuous habitation of the island until around 25,000 BC, when evidence of temporary camps starts.

    "question": "Consider the following reflection from a university course in Education. Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher. Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that “an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration” (para 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this – lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn’t quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the “meaning and significance” (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit “big brother” and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher. These kinds of ‘learning processes’ throughout a teaching career are important because they force us to revaluate our practice; to, in effect, become aware. Brookfield, S. (1995).

    "question": "Consider the following essay question. Discuss the series of events that led to the First World War. What part did the system of alliances play in causing the conflict? Was a military arms race between the Great Powers a major influence? Did colonialism play a part in leading to the conflict? Here is a student’s essay introduction and conclusion in response to this question. The First World War was one of the largest conflicts of the 20th century, leading to millions of deaths both in Europe and around the world. Unlike other conflicts in the 20th century, the causes of the conflict were many and various, and historians have had a difficult time deciding what the primary causes were. The system of alliances, rising militarism amongst the Great Powers, the politics surrounding a united Germany, and even the Industrial Revolution have been posited as short and long term causes of the war. However, it is two of these in particular – the system of alliances in Europe, and a military arms race in Europe – that were particularly prominent causes of the conflict. To sum up, the combination of the system of alliances and rising militarism amongst European countries – leading to an arms race amongst the countries – were the two main causes of the First World War. The system of alliances lead to an “excessively rigid framework” (Taylor, 1969), which was unable to deal with diplomatic events such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Coupled with this was the immense military buildup and planning amongst the Great Powers, which created a great impetus for war. It is these two issues, in excess of others, that led to the bloodshed of the First World War. The student has unfortunately failed to address one part of the question. Which part of the question has the student failed to answer? Check one option.",

You have found a journal article for your assignment; the abstract of the article is below. Read the abstract and answer the question below. There are increasing policy debates on the efficacy of universal basic income (UBI) within both political and academic circles. These debates have emerged as a response to failures of the welfare state on the one hand, and the threat to employment posed by increasing automation on the other. While issues surrounding introduction and maintenance of the UBI have been explored at some length in sociological and political science literature, economics as a discipline has been slow to enter this discussion. This paper applies a new institutional economic framework to explore the effects of UBI on the economy as well as broader social effects. It shows that while the costs of implementation and the threat of work disincentives are greater than has previously been indicated, the benefits of introducing a UBI far outweigh the drawbacks, particularly when an ongoing decrease in manual and middle class jobs due to automation is assumed. Implications for welfare and social policy are explored. We need to decide if it is relevant. How useful is this for your assignment? Check one option .",

This study seeks to explore the educational affordances and constraints of English language teacher robots in Korea. With small but increasing use of AIs in service industries, there is a growing literature on the impact of robots and AI on everyday social interactions in a number of contexts; however, the effects of robots and AIs in educational contexts remain relatively unexplored. This study used ethnographic means to explore the impact of English language teacher robots in 3 primary school settings in Korea. It combined ethnographic non-participant observation with interviews to look at how language teaching could be technologically supported, drawing on the workplace studies of Heath and Luff (2000) to look at how the use of technologically-mediated language instruction offered a new range of affordances and constraints to both students and teachers.
